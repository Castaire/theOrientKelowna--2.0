# The Orient Restaurant v2.0 - Kelowna
## About
This is a re-re-design of a website I previously built for a local restaurant 'The Orient', located in Kelowna, B.C. This project is currently in progress! 

I am still maintaining v1.0 of this site, which can be found at the link below!

## Objectives
- a more responsive and cohesive design
- less HTML / CSS clutter

## Materials
- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript (eventually!)
- Bootstrap (possibly)
- Node.js (not really necessary, but just in case XD)
